# Brief Description
This directory will include various commonly algorithms.

## Algorithms:
* Binary Search

## How this will work (my plan):
* A new algorithm will be added each week. Time will be spent learning,
    implementing, and applying the current algorithm for 5 - 6 days with
    1 - 2 hours spent per day.
    Time: 5-6 days, 1-2 hours/day

* Note that time will be spent every Saturday (or free time during
    weekend) reviewing all accumulated algorithms I've learned thus
    far.
    Time: 1 day, 1-2 hours/day (or as time permits).

## Comments
* My goal with this activity is to be as consistent as possible,
    and listen to my mental health, i.e., modify workload as needed
    to prevent burnout.
*  School, work, and any external obligations come before this.
    However, I've made the time slots pretty minimal so I shouldn't
    have many (if any at all) time conflicts.
