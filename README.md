# Brief Description of /[Topic]
These directories will contain:
* Solutions to LeetCode problems based on a specific category (e.g., Arrays, Strings, Hashmaps, etc.)
* Data Structures practice
* Algorithms practice

## How LeetCode will work (my plan): *** This will be on pause until I'm confident in my DS and Algs ***
I will spend 2 days each week reviewing 4 LeetCode questions based
    on a specific topic (one day = 2 questions), and then another 2
    days reviewing the previous questions/solutions.

# Brief Description of /Algorithm-Practice and /Data-Structures-Practice
This directory will include various commonly algorithms.

## How this will work (my plan):
* A new algorithm and data structurewill be added each week. Time will be spent learning,
    implementing, and applying the current algorithm and data structure for 5 - 6 days with
    1 - 2 hours spent per day.
    Time: 5-6 days, 1-2 hours/day
* Note that time will be spent every Saturday (or free time during
    weekend) reviewing all accumulated algorithms and data structuresI've learned thus
    far.
    Time: 1 day, 1-2 hours/day (or as time permits).

## Comments
* I will be documenting each algorithm within a Google doc: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7j3ger1A6avkL0r4ZzcuKe-OHbnV0NxHKokwY5vFlU/edit?usp=sharing) and each data structure here [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-HOth5rvL0N4TsnugZ77MdBWG96_87R2K6caT0LE4K0/edit#)
* My goal with this activity is to be as consistent as possible,
    and listen to my mental health, i.e., modify workload as needed
    to prevent burnout.
* School, work, and any external obligations come before this.
    However, I've made the time slots pretty minimal so I shouldn't
    have many (if any at all) time conflicts.
